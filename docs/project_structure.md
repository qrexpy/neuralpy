# Your Guide to the neural.py Codebase

Welcome to neural.py! This guide will help you navigate the project so you can find exactly what you need and understand how everything fits together.

## The Big Picture

Here's how the project is organized:

```

├── src/                     # Where the magic happens
│   ├── neural.py            # The main neural network implementation
│   └── visualization.py     # Tools to see what your network is doing
├── tests/                   # Making sure everything works properly
│   └── test_neural_network.py  # Examples and test cases
├── docs/                    # You are here! Documentation to help you
│   ├── arguments.md         # All the knobs and dials you can adjust
│   ├── activation_functions.md # Learn about activation functions

```

## What's in Each File?

### The Core: src/neural.py

This is the heart of the project - it contains the `NeuralNetwork` class that does all the heavy lifting:

- Creates networks with any number of layers and neurons
- Performs forward propagation to make predictions
- Implements backpropagation to learn from examples
- Supports mini-batch training for efficiency
- Offers multiple activation functions (Sigmoid, ReLU, Leaky ReLU)

Think of it as your neural network construction kit - everything you need to build and train networks from scratch!

### Making It Visual: src/visualization.py

These tools let you "see" what your neural network is doing:

- Training progress charts to watch learning happen
- Confusion matrices to understand classification errors
- Network architecture diagrams to visualize your design
- Decision boundary plots to see how your network divides the world
- Weight distribution histograms to check for potential issues

It's like having X-ray vision into your neural network's brain!

### Proving It Works: tests/test_neural_network.py

This file shows neural.py in action, with examples like:

- Solving the XOR problem (a classic test for neural networks)
- Simple digit recognition (distinguishing 0s from 1s)
- Visualizations that bring concepts to life

These examples also serve as templates you can adapt for your own projects.

### The Library Card: Documentation Files

Each documentation file serves a specific purpose:

- **arguments.md**: Lists all parameters you can adjust, with explanations of what they do
- **activation_functions.md**: Explains the different activation functions and when to use them
- **visualization.md**: Shows you how to create visualizations of your network
- **examples.md**: Walks through practical applications and how to run them
- **project_structure.md**: You're reading it right now!

### Getting Started: Configuration Files

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python packages needed (numpy, matplotlib, etc.)
- **README.md**: The first place to look - gives you a quick overview and basic usage

## How to Use This Project

1. **Start**: Clone the repository and install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Learn**: Run the tests to see examples: `python tests/test_neural_network.py`
3. **Build**: Import the neural network in your own code: `from src.neural import NeuralNetwork`
4. **Explore**: Try the examples to see real-world applications

The best part? It's all built from scratch, so you can see exactly how neural networks work under the hood!
